# `rise-tag`

## Introduction

`rise-tag` is used for specifying lookup or freeform tags, their names, and their values. It is intended to be used by the `rise-storage` web component, which will return only those files from Rise Storage that have been labelled with the appropriate tags.

`rise-tag` works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Usage
To use `rise-tag`, you should first install `webcomponents.js`. The `webcomponents.js` polyfills enable Web Components in (evergreen) browsers that lack native support.

To install with Bower:
```
bower install webcomponentsjs
```

To install with npm:
```
npm install webcomponents.js
```

Next, install `rise-storage` and `rise-tag` with Bower:
```
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/web-component-rise-storage.git
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/web-component-rise-tag.git
```

Finally, construct your HTML page. You should include `webcomponents.js` before any code that touches the DOM, and load the web components using HTML Imports. For example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents.js"></script>
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/web-component-rise-storage/rise-storage.html">
    <link rel="import" href="bower_components/web-component-rise-tag/rise-tag.html">
  </head>
  <body>
    <rise-storage companyId="my-company-id">
      <rise-tag type="lookup" name="brand" value="nike"></rise-tag>
    </rise-storage>

    <script>
      // Wait for 'polymer-ready'. Ensures the element is upgraded.
      window.addEventListener('polymer-ready', function(e) {
        var storage = document.querySelector('rise-storage');

        // Respond to events it fires.
        storage.addEventListener('rise-storage-response', function(e) {
          // e.detail contains the JSON response.
        });
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Attributes
| Attribute              | Type                                                                            | Default          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------:|
| `type` (required)      | `<string>` One of `lookup` or `freeform`.                                       | `'lookup'`       |
| `name` (required)      | `<string>` The tag name.                                                        | `''`             |
| `value` (optional)     | `<string>` The tag value.                                                       | `''`             |

* If both `type` and `name` are specified, but `value` is not, then all files that have that particular type of tag (i.e. `lookup` or `freeform`) assigned to them, with a tag name set as per the `name` attribute, regardless of the tagâ€™s value, are returned.
* If `type`, `name`, and `value` are specified, then all files that have that particular type of tag (i.e. `lookup` or `freeform`), with a tag name set as per the `name` attribute and a tag value set as per the `value` attribute, are returned.
* When filtering by tags, the `folder` and `fileName` attributes on `rise-storage`, if specified, are ignored.

## Examples
To specify a tag, a `rise-tag` element is nested inside of a `rise-storage` element. Multiple `rise-tag` elements can be added:
```
<rise-storage companyId="abc123">
  <rise-tag type="lookup" name="brand" value="levi"></rise-tag>
  <rise-tag type="freeform" name="discount"></rise-tag>
</rise-storage>
```

In the above example, all files for company _abc123_ that have a lookup tag name of _brand_ with a value of _levi_ AND have a freeform tag with a name of _discount_ and any tag value, are returned.

Multiple tag values can be specified by separating them with a space. For example:
```
<rise-storage companyId="abc123">
  <rise-tag type="lookup" name="brand" value="levi nike"></rise-tag>
</rise-storage>
```
This would return all files for company _abc123_ that have a lookup tag name of _brand_ with a value of _levi_ OR a value of _nike_.

## Built With
- [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/)
- [Polymer core-ajax](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html#core-ajax)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.org)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) for testing

## Development

### Dependencies
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is used to manage our source code on Github.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) & [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - npm is the default package manager for Node.js. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. These dependencies are listed in the _package.json_ file.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for Javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party Javascript dependencies are listed in the _bower.json_ file.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a Javascript task runner. It lints, runs unit and E2E (end-to-end) tests, minimizes files, etc. Gulp tasks are defined in _gulpfile.js_.

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
To make changes to the web component, you'll first need to install the dependencies:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js and npm](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) - To install Bower, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g bower`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g bower`.
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - To install Gulp, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g gulp`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g gulp`.

The web components can now be installed by executing the following commands in Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/web-component-rise-tag.git
cd web-component-rise-tag
npm install
bower install
```

### Run Locally
You can access the `demo.html` file via a local web server. On Mac, execute the following command from the root directory of the web component:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This starts a web server on port 8000, and you can access the Rise Storage web component by navigating to `localhost:8000/demo.html`.

### Testing
You can run the suite of tests via a local web server. On Mac, execute the following command from the root directory of the web component:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This starts a web server on port 8000, and you can run the tests by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/test/index.html`.

### Deployment
Once you are satisifed with your changes, deploy the `components` and `rise-tag` folders to your server. You can then use the web component by following the *Usage* instructions.
